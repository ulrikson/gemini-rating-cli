ideas
- fine tune the model with an interface for the user to provide feedback on the model's responses
- store results in a database or text file
- ask at the end of the conversation if the user would like to save the conversation, then save it to a file
- just train on the conversations with a score higher than X
- if generalizing this logic enough, i could make it a public repository
